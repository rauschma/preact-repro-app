## Installation

These two projects must be siblings in the same directory:

* `preact-repro-lib`
* `preact-repro-app`

Next:

```
cd preact-repro-lib
npm install

preact-repro-app
npm install
```

Optional: Compiling the TypeScript (lib first, then app). But the TypeScript output is included in the repo.

## Running the app

```
cd preact-repro-app
node dist/main.js
```
